hey man this is a game and its pretty epic.
Its a joke about league where everything is random and you can do nothing to control the outcome.
There are many fun game mechanics, such as being able to run it down mid, several timed events, and being able to tilt your teammates.
No matter what you do,your teammates hate you for doing something wrong.
You always lose the lanning phase.
You always lose the mid-late game.
In the end, you always lose.
